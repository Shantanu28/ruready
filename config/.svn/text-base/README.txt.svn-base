Configuring RU2 for a New Environment
=====================================
To configure your RU2 for your specific environment, follow these steps:

1. Assuming that $ru2 is your home build directory (the parent directory of the
directory your are reading this file from) and that tomcat is installed in $tomcat_home.
2. Copy build.properties to $ru2.
3. Copy config/your_config_name/hibernate_*.cfg.xml to $ru2/src.
4. Copy config/your_config_name/ru2.xml to $tomcat_home/conf/Catalina/localhost. Create Catalina and
Catalina/localhost directories if they don't yet exist under $tomcat_home/conf.
